      <h2> Where can you smoke? </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2> How much cannabis can you legally have? </h2>
    </div>

      <h3> Those 21 and over may possess up to 28.5 grams of cannabis, or up to 8 grams of concentrated cannabis.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2> Can you smoke (be under the influence) then drive?  </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <h3>Driving under the influence is still illegal and consumption in the vehicle is not allowed.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2>Can you smoke at public events such as a concert or sporting event? </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <h3> Generally no, if there is no smoking at the venue, there is also no cannabis smoking either. Also no smoking in public unless permitted by the city. </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2> Can you smoke on privately owned business such as at a bar? </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <h3> Generally no smoking at a bar, because a vendor or business can't sell both cannabis and alcohol. Lounges licenced by city can have people smoking in there. Employees are entitled to a notice though under Prop 65 that they may be breathing smoke that can be dangerous for their health. </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2> Can you smoke or be high in the workplace?</h2>

    <div class="answer">
      <h3> Drivers can have marijuana in their vehicles, but it must be in a container in the trunk. Driving under the influence is still illegal and consumption in the vehicle is not allowed.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2> Does the legalization of recreational marijuana sales change drug testing policies for job applicants?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <h3> The new law "specifically does not change the legal status between employers and employees when it comes to drug testing and employment," said Tamar Todd, legal affairs director for Drug Policy Alliance, a national drug law reform group that supported the 2016 passage of Proposition 64, which legalized the sale of recreational marijuana in California.
</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h2> Can jobs still test for marijuana now that it’s legal?
</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <h3> Yes they can. Prop. 64 clearly stated that employers can test workers for marijuana and choose to not hire new workers — or fire existing workers — for any positive test. And some employers, such as federal agencies or transportation workers, are required to test for cannabis. </h3>
    </div>
