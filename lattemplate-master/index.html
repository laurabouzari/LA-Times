 <h1> How well do you know your rights?</h1>

    <p> Marijuana was legalized in California just four months ago. Yet the laws regarding where and when it can be used remain hazey. </p>


<p>Stewart Richlin, an attorney at 420 Law who specializes in cannabis rights, said that the state has a “checkerboard pattern” of different rules.</p>


<p>“There are different rules in each city,” Richlin said. “We need uniform state rules.” </p>


<p>While many of the regulations depend on the city or county one is in, there are some hard and fast rules that apply to the entire state.  </p>
